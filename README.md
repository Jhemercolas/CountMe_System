# A HUMAN COUNTING FOR CROWD CONTROL AND SOCIAL DISTANCING SYSTEM USING IMAGE RECOGNITION

     Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered and reported in Wuhan, China, by the end of 2019.
     The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the virus rapidly spreading and is profoundly affecting lives around the globe.

     After the easing of quarantine measures in the Philippines on May 16, 2020,
     the Department of Health (DOH) issued a strong recommendation to the general public regarding the adoption of social distancing
     as a preventive measure against the transmission of COVID-19.

     Welcome to CountMe, a system that is expected to greatly assist in keeping adequate social distance in crowded environments
     such as malls, offices, schools, public markets, and other public places.
